# CRISPR-TAPE
A protein-centric CRISPR gRNA design tool for TArgeted Protein Engineering

# Motivation 
Existing CRIPSR gRNA design tools target protein-coding regions within genomic loci and non-specifically target the entire input region of DNA. Current tools fail to consider proteomic-based applications, so CRISPR-TAPE has been developed to reduce the substantial time burden associated with manual curation of gRNA libraries and empower the proteomics community. 

# Technologies 
The CRISPR-TAPE python scripts are compatible with Python 3.0 and later versions of Python and outside of the standard library, makes use of the following packages:
•	numpy version 1.18.0
•	pandas version 0.25.3
